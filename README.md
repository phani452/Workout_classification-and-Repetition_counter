# Workout_classification-and-Repetition_counter
Keeping a check on the type of exercises and its count is a boring task and this leads to workout routines performed going unaccounted for. 
We have taken a small step towards addressing this issue by keeping a numerical account of the fitness regimen carried out by the user.
# objective
Our project tries to automate this process and provides the scope to document and analyze the userâ€™s workout activities.
# flow of process
video input -> video to frames -> excercise recognition -> repetition counting -> summary
